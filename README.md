# Distributions_from_U(0-1)

In this project, I recreated distributions using only stochastic values realized from a continuous uniform distribution. This helped me review the purpose of so called "name brand" distributions while understanding the relationship between them. It also allowed me to get more experience with NumPy and Matplotlib.

Future plans with this project include adding more distributions.
